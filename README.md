# Security Automation Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Python-based security automation tools I have developed.  
They demonstrate my ability to apply coding to solve real-world cybersecurity challenges.

## Projects

1. **Port Scanner**  
   Scans common ports on a target IP to identify open services.  
   [View Project](./01-port-scanner)

2. **Log Analyzer**  
   Detects repeated failed SSH login attempts from Linux auth logs.  
   [View Project](./02-log-analyzer)

3. **AES Encryption Tool**  
   Encrypts and decrypts strings using AES-256 with random keys.  
   [View Project](./03-aes-encryption)

4. **API Method Tester**  
   Tests which HTTP methods are allowed on a target API endpoint.  
   [View Project](./04-api-method-tester)
